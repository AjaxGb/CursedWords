but look on the even brighter side
ow
meeting your spirit is a sure sign that its link with you is reaching maturity which means you'll be getting a power of your own any day now
i already got magnet powers which is cool and all but not like to die for y'know
but think of all the loose change you could find and then return to the people who dropped it
magnet powers you say that's stupendid
isaac is that an injury
thank you
ah it's just a scratch don't
mrrff
you're anxious about all this spectral business i get that really i do
you've had a startling new world appear in front of you and there's a lot to learn you don't know where to start or who to trust
rrrrgh
still at the same time it's exciting ghosts and spirits and powers a part of you wants to immerse yourself in it all and just see what happens
ahaha
but whether or not everything turns out for the better you don't want to go it alone
to which i say join the club we all felt the same way still do you won't find anyone more understanding of what you're going through than us
ahahahahaha
