heightened perception so i'm seeing hidden things like with ghosts
no no it's in your head like a vision sort of
isaac could you demonstrate
hmph i could
why are you sitting like that
you heard him pull me in alread-
should be
how long was that for you
umm little less than a minute
so you see time feels warped because your body and brain are moving so fast your percieved reality is similarly warped by your spirit's influence hence junk ruins etcetera however oh er may i see your backpack maxwell
uh sure
thank you
however the vision is essentially real to you so if you were to say get your head bitten off by your spirit that carries over to real life
whaat h-h-how is that
it's a supernatural thing i wouldn't worry about it
about how it works i mean you should definitely worry about getting your head bitten off
