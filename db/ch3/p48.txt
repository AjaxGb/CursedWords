i don't care how minor the request you will refuse the glasses man's orders as a matter of principle
ooh you have principles now
i don't understand isaac child boy why does my fearsome might not inspire the same respect you give the door creature for outlining your inadequacies in vapid sermons
don't insult doorman he's helped me unlike you
ha it is easy to preach nonviolence
when you are weeeeeeaaak
we are not so different you and i
groan
the door's lessons weren't with you when you let loose lightning to scare that sphinx nor when you expressed your annoyance toward the glasses man with electricity though you knew it harmless you may be reluctant to bite but you bare your fangs readily
grk
your fury is righteous your anger divine oaths of restraint are not for you you are an agent of judgement
now hear my sermon let it have few words as befits a god's commandments
good is that which evil fears
and justice is when you make those fears a reality
i'm beginning to think i've already been giving you more respect than i
should be
