look you don't need a tool to be powerful let me explain
when a resilient spirit is mortally wounded
it can stop itself from disappearing entirely by hiding inside an object
the possessed object lures a suitable spectral into finding it then feeds off of their energy
in return the host spectral gets to wield the spirit's powers through the object that's a tool
once it's absorbed enough energy the spirit emerges from the tool completely restored
huh i uh don't think i'm old enough for a symbiotic relationship
there's more
if they can find one in time spirits will possess a host directly
that works the same way except the host gets to use the spirit's powers all on their own
that's me i'm possessed
ha you're a tool
shut up
