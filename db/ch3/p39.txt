for my own and others' safety i am in hiding please swear that you will tell no one about me or this place can you keep this promise
i'd laugh
but i didn't end up with the sense of humor
your return changes nothing schemer my master does not fear broken gods
she should would if she could the comedy your ignorance breeds is wasted on my ears well not my ears exactly
arrogance your power is nothing to be afraid of riddles and word games
from which speaking esoteric languages won't protect you and i wasn't referring to my faction though you do underestimate us
we'd better hurry the buses are pulling in
rolling tubes of screaming children each as worthless as this sanctimonious fool's approval if you must be pious boy choose a proper priest
huh
what
sorry were you saying something
n-no please proceed
thanks doorman i'll visit you later
