hey how did you find my house did isabel send you
no i just happened to this is your house
well then i don't know what's worse that you're not here as a bodyguard after last night's debacle
or that every single one of you activity club weirdos now knows where i live
wait what happened last night
a ton crazy supernatural things and no one's telling me what i want to know
man join the club
why will that help
what no i meant
like join the club of not not being told what
no joining the activity club will not help no
