morning patrol reporting in
ah just a moment isabel i believe i've accidentally traumatized the new recruit
i've never gotten my head bitten off before man i don't wanna take that risk
now maxwell there is nothing to be afraid of if you feel you are in danger while in a spirit trance simply distance yourself from your tool and the vision will end
the basis of your connection with your spirit is a mental link if it can't get at your mind it can't hurt you or help you for that matter
that is why i threw your backpack all the way over there while you're close to that bat your spirit will be sharing your senses so it's wise to not give it any ideas it may not already have
about murdering you i mean
yeah i got that thanks
but look on the bright side
since your spirit can see what you see it'll know the sort of tough customers it's going to have to deal with if it messes with you
