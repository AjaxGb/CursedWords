i thought learning was half your club's purpose
i mean in theory sure but mr. spender's favored teaching mechanism is
sloooooow
dramaaatic
speeches
for the last two years i've been taught in sparse little prose nuggets and then only when the information was contextually relevant
you know this reminds me of a curious little anecdote about spectral ethics
the context usually involves mortal peril
isaac fun fact ectoplasm has semi-corrosive properties
the others they don't care ed likes what isabel likes and isabel only likes fighting
that thing with the paper and the sunset probably rehearsed
probably choreographed by demons
you're really not selling me on the whole activity club lifestyle bro
