young master isaac i was expecting someone else
max meet the shortcut shortcut max
you refer to me by my function how human
oh uh i didn't mean anything by it doorman
if its name is an occupation how is that not also referring to it by its function
shut up max
did you not in exchange for my assistance promise to keep me and my location a secret when first we met
don't worry max won't tell he's new and
young master isaac you have spoken of your vow to not use your powers to destroy and to use violence only to defend you do not swear these things lightly or without cause this i know
however
you broke the promise between us because you did not fear the consequences of doing so i have not the strength to stop you should you decide to reduce me to mere function to make a tool of me you have the storms you have my secrets
in your heart you knew these things and allowed them to influence your behavior this was in itself a small act of violence thus our bond withers into a power relationship
or it's just a man who looks like a door that doesn't actually function as a doorman despite dressing like one in which case its name isn't its function it's a description interesting
you have seen the damage a lightning bolt can do if you wish to be truly just you must understand the destruction wrought by the shadow of a stormcloud
