hold up you've got questions that i have answers to
why isn't every inch of the earth filled with the ghosts of dead bugs
and i've got questions mr. spender has answers to
why haven't you sold your magic students for mad black market greens yet
mr. spender wants you to join the club
wants it bad
so you use that as leverage to get him to answer my questions and i'll answer yours
ah ha one of those you scratch my back
i threaten a teacher situations
forget waiting for the bus we can take my secret shortcut
