still though wouldn't it be logical to test your queries out on me before worrying about other sources
didn't you have a question for mr. spender about mr. spender max
did you
i did
hate you
ahem
who do you work for
the government
i am after all a public school teacher
i must say maxwell these are strange questions for a beginner to ask
his questions make sense i know i wouldn't want to unwittingly be doing spec work for some evil syndicate
the purely hypothetical organization i may or may not work for is an unequivocal and entirely figurative force for good
then why not acknowledge its obvious existence i've seen mr. walker seen others in the same weird suits seen those mooks at isabel's place
isaac i know you're frustrated and i feel very ███ about that but █████ ██████████ to ██████████ █████ with █████████ ██████████ ███ ████████
stop doing that
