so pj have you been uh dead for long
too long
too long you planning to to pass on soon
not my choice ghosts get all white n' forgetty after a while then they just fade away
well how long is a while
well it depe-
five years
my mom she if i could talk to
was hers a sudden grisly sort of death
c-come agai- i mean i gue-
great
all the more reason for your mother's phantom husk to still be haunting this torturous plane
