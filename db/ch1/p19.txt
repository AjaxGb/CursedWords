and then the sunnova baker comes at me from behind swingin' a baguette like some kinda psychopath
heh only a coward would attack a man with his back turned
a coward or someone confident their bread's stale enough to take me out in one hit
so what happened then johnny
what do you think happened i ducked the loaf and gave him the ol' one two finish
he's gonna need a whole lotta yeast to rise after one-a your punches
nobody ever gets the drop on me
hm
