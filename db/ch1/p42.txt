being with us is like being in all clubs 'cause we spy on everyone else
suzy i will call the police i will call them and they will take you away
oh yeah well then uh what's the activity club do
good question
pandora's box max you just ripped it in half
let me tell you a story max it was the start of sixth grade
my first assignment as a new member of the journalism club was to write an article about the school's organizations
i went to every club every team figured out their purpose meeting times their number of members except for one the activity club
every time i tried to interview them the jerks'd give me the slip i couldn't even figure out what they do
i was forced to turn the article in incomplete
they're not so bad
they're a bunch of nerd mooching off of the school budget dimitri
gosh that's swell
yeah well i'm over it i could care less if they're a cult or some kinda crime ring
nice lunch
huh oh uh yeah
