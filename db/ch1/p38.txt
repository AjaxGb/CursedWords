hello the door was unlocked
hello isaac
oh sir i didn't see you there what with the lights off
ah yes sorry about that isaac i was just checking the room for night lamps
they're very shy little spirits you see and only reveal themselves in the dark
ohh i see were there any
a few
what was i oh right sir i think i found another person like us
what
there was this kid i'd never seen before aaand he was talking about seeing see through purple things and then i could've sworn i saw him mistake some of them for real people those are the textbook signs he's gonna become like us right
i-indeed someone you'd never seen before
we have to get this guy right i'll find isabel and
wait
you don't have to do anything
huh b-but if this guy starts seeing everything and we're not around he's gonna flip his nuggets just like
i know isaac i know but if what you said is true he's only in the early stages
we've got time and besides
there's a good chance this kid you'd never seen before will be coming straight to me
