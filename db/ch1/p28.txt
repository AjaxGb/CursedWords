great i'm suzy and this is my assistant collin
i'm more like a slave
oh uh nice to meet you
i'll bet listen i run the school newspaper
it's more like a pamphlet
you being here being you being new present the both of us with a unique opportunity
what
sorry i'd love to chat but i'm late and it's my first day so
late you're not late school doesn't start for at least another half hour
more like fifteen minutes
you'd better be ready by eight o'clock zoey in mayview they send tardy kids to the mines
it's 8:15 my bus isn't here yet and you're a liar dad
you've got the time max and we've got the know-how we'll give you a tour of the school if you'll answer a few questions along the way
um ok i guess
ok cool first things first welcome to mayview middle school
