a fart joke
i what
the doorknob fool
pull my finger you were thinkin' it was a set up for a fart joke wurntcha
it's a push door
wisecracker huh i'll have you know that there door swings both ways
should i read into that
yes
if this room is to some extent a manifestation of my subconscious mind it's only natural that stuff should exit as easy as it enters
i'd like to assume that was self deprecation but this door is making it difficult
maybe don't interrupt while i'm queuin' a swig
