you are being modest mister max it is very brave to stand up to people older than you

if i were you
yeah well i couldn't do that dad thinks everything in mayview is perfect you should have heard him on the ride down here
max zoey
everything in mayview is perfect
i wouldn't want to ruin that image for him so quickly
sounds to me like you were protecting more than just stuff after all

a great hero needs a great hero name um like
batman
