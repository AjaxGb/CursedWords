um
it's just i was under the impression that the collective opinion of our organization was that the cousinhood of man
is icky
i don't know what business this fellow who approached walker thinks he has in mayview but whatever his reasons are they aren't good enough for me
i completely agree
hmmmm
hmmmm
i wouldn't let those weirdos near any populated area if i could they're dangerous and gross
like really super icky
then why would you do what would you what what
i wanted to see how you'd react
it was informative
why were ya keepin' me in the dark about this i put my full weight behind this cousinhood nonsense
i wanted to see how you'd react
it was entertaining
hee hee hoo hoo hee ha ha ha
