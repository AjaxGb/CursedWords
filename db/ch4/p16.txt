my point was if anyone wants t'come on in this here dream room all they gotta do is knock politely i ain't got no secrets
you wanna know the last time i cried fine last week when i passed some roadkill on the highway
you wanna know what cologne i use fine it's poise by chafresh
i don't want to know either of those things
but honesty's a door that swings both ways you gonna pick my brain i'm gonna speak my brain an' i'll tell y'right now ricky boy
i don't like ya an' i don't trust ya
i don't like how you won't let no one inside your room not even the boss
an' i don't trust yer word when y'say yer flocka lambs ain't got no wolves mixed in especially when you won't let no sheepdogs near your pasture
you're not that dog's master texas it's liable to take a few sheep itself
farmanalogies aside i'd prefer to have this conversation once b.l. arrives
what which of those rats told you about that was supposed t'be
a secret
please do forgive walker's hypocrisy i asked him not to tell you i'd be here
