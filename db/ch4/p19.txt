don't worry rick i would never let a stranger onto your turf without your permission
which is why we'll send one of our boys to mayview to look into the cousinhood's concerns they might find something you missed
so that's your game
faced with the threat of frenzied vigilantes being set loose in my town a visit from a fellow agent sounds like a reasonable alternative
getting my consent for an internal investigation was your goal all along
did you set it up this way to spare my feelings it's touching you'd bother though i'm a little insulted you hoped me too dull to realize when i'm being strongarmed
the cousinhood was that a lie were they even interested in mayview in the first place
no no they definitely were you just seized the opportunity they presented that's why walker was kept out of the loop
whatchy'all whisperin' about
if he's not in on the trick he has no reason to lie about the cousinhood approaching him and i can't claim the whole thing's one big fabrication
i'm thoroughly trapped even having figured all this out i can hardly refuse a cordial inspection without appearing suspicious not with outside experts raising red flags
heh well played boss
don't whine so much rick it's inelegant there's no consolation prize for describing how you lost
i can't call it a loss that would suggest an internal investigation gives me something to lose
so would your entire monologue you ridiculous nerd
