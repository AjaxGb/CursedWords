	mm-hmmf
	faint purple wisps that appear and disappear in a heartbeat seeing them is how it begins
	we call these visions shades
	they'll appear more frequently and in greater detail until eventually you see them for what they really are
	ghosts
	some of them yeah
	that creature that attacked you wasn't a ghost it was a spirit
	unlike ghosts spirits were never alive for lack of a better word
	those drawings are horrendous for lack of a better word
	isaac you're embarrassing the whole club
</page>
<page num="64">
	people like us we've gained properties normally reserved for apparitions producing the tinted vapor we call spectral energy for example it's like we're dead without being dead
	zombies
	no
	ok so ghosts are real hot dog why can i see them
	a near death experience prolonged exposure to supernatural phenomena a diet obnoxiously high in citrus
	irrelevant what matters is what you do with your talents now that you have them
	become a middle school teacher
	a comedian how charming
	hrm well introductions you know me of course
	right mr. splendid
	spender
	ahem moving right along this is ed
	we've met
	over here we have isabel
	sorry about the whole closet thing
	and lastly we have isaac who is desperately trying to claw his way up from his position as club mascot by undermining my authority
	i will dance on your grave sir
</page>
<page num="65">
	and together we are
	the activity club
	oh yeah how'd you know
	it's written on the door along with paranatural whatever that means
	it's the words paranormal and supernatural combined because that's what we what we're concerned with paranatural activity yeah the paranatural activity club
	yeah but only we can see that first part 'cause i done painter'd it
	come again
	show don't tell
	aye sir

	gladly
</page>
<page num="66">
	oh god what
	you're lucky you know
	bwoahsnap
	a privileged few are granted the ability to observe the world of the supernatural
	and fewer still are given the tools to shape it
	as you have been
	i believe that baseball bat is one of the rare supernatural objects we call tools
	it engineered its encounter with you and jump started your development as a spectral
	where is the bleeping door
	what no don't go superpowers it gives you superpowers
</page>
<page num="67">
	superpowers
	yes yes like controlling paper cool huh
	the coolest
	you're saying i'll get superpowers if i join your club that seems sketch
	what no the bat will give you some sort of power regardless of whether
	oh cool i just won't join the club then
	wh- n-no you
	you need us to keep you from being eaten 'til you powers come in
	is that a thing is that a thing that happens
	isaac
	the activity club's primary purpose is the pacification of evil spirits
	b-but it's also a way for spectral youth like yourself to learn about the supernatural
	mostly we just mess around though
	onion onion un-yun
	i-i'm gonna go
	i'll think about it joining that is maybe probably not unlikely that i won't join
	well
	we gotta go too or grandpa will be ticked
	at least he took the bat

<page num="68">
	crime of all crimes
	max ignores my invitation and then starts flitting about with the activity club

	no no no they're exchanging contact information
	so ghosts are like totally a secret ok
	we saw him first no don't wave goodbye spit in their faces
	o-oh i get it he's infiltrating them to do some hardcore muckraking yeah
	i'd shatter that sad illusion but it's probably the only thing keeping you from blowing up his house

<page num="4">
	hey how did you find my house did isabel send you
	no i just happened to this is your house
	well then i don't know what's worse that you're not here as a bodyguard after last night's debacle
	or that every single one of you activity club weirdos now knows where i live
	wait what happened last night
	a ton crazy supernatural things and no one's telling me what i want to know
	man join the club
	why will that help
	what no i meant
	like join the club of not not being told what
	no joining the activity club will not help no
</page>
<page num="5">
	i thought learning was half your club's purpose
	i mean in theory sure but mr. spender's favored teaching mechanism is
	sloooooow
	dramaaatic
	speeches
	for the last two years i've been taught in sparse little prose nuggets and then only when the information was contextually relevant
	you know this reminds me of a curious little anecdote about spectral ethics
	the context usually involves mortal peril
	isaac fun fact ectoplasm has semi-corrosive properties
	the others they don't care ed likes what isabel likes and isabel only likes fighting
	that thing with the paper and the sunset probably rehearsed
	probably choreographed by demons
	you're really not selling me on the whole activity club lifestyle bro
</page>
<page num="6">
	hold up you've got questions that i have answers to
	why isn't every inch of the earth filled with the ghosts of dead bugs
	and i've got questions mr. spender has answers to
	why haven't you sold your magic students for mad black market greens yet
	mr. spender wants you to join the club
	wants it bad
	so you use that as leverage to get him to answer my questions and i'll answer yours
	ah ha one of those you scratch my back
	i threaten a teacher situations
	forget waiting for the bus we can take my secret shortcut
</page>
<page num="7">
	your shortcut is downhill the school is in the opposite direction
	at the opposite elevation
	just trust me max it's a
	spectral thing
	yes that
	does it have something to do with that key you were fondling dramatically
	yeah we'll wha where'd it did i drop it
	give iiit don't be a jerk
	haha watch those hair spikes i don't want gel poisoning
</page>
<page num="8">
	you're mad because this key's your tool right
	nope don't have one
	what i broke my brooding persona for nothing
	yoink
	so what you do the club's laundry taxes
	please i'm not useless i could completely destroy ed and isabel together
	well that's a dark thought to've thunk ya creep do you assess the murderability of all your friends
	it's just a fact
	sooo completely destroy them at chess competitive laundry
	shut uuup max
</page>
<page num="9">
	look you don't need a tool to be powerful let me explain
	when a resilient spirit is mortally wounded
	it can stop itself from disappearing entirely by hiding inside an object
	the possessed object lures a suitable spectral into finding it then feeds off of their energy
	in return the host spectral gets to wield the spirit's powers through the object that's a tool
	once it's absorbed enough energy the spirit emerges from the tool completely restored
	huh i uh don't think i'm old enough for a symbiotic relationship
	there's more
	if they can find one in time spirits will possess a host directly
	that works the same way except the host gets to use the spirit's powers all on their own
	that's me i'm possessed
	ha you're a tool
	shut up
</page>
<page num="10">
	i'm not a tool max i'm a medium
	yeah i'm a large bazowzow huh ha
	shutupshutupshutupshutup
	hehe so you're trying to tell me ed's spirit just happened upon a huge stretchy paintbrush to possess
	a normal one tools start to look like their spirits as they recover mediums too
	is your spirit a big ol' dork
	cut it out max you wouldn't like me when i'm angry and all that the only physical manifestation of my possession is my hair which is

	negotiate
</page>
<page num="33">
	i-it doesn't matter answer my riddles or be devoured those were the rules once you agree to play my rules are law
	i didn't agree to anything
	participation is tacit agreement
	then you're about to agree to get hit with a bat
	your game's rigged you shoehorned in eating us after the first riddle
	wait seriously
	yes
	i'll be going then
	mm
	the others will hear about this
	tell them about how i shoot lightning
	tell me about how you shoot lightning
	i can create and manipulate weather
	can we stop tumbling down hills looking for shortcuts and instead just make it a snow day
	i can't do big stuff like that only what you saw even then sometimes it's
	hard to control
	shut uuup
</page>
<page num="34">
	well then ready for the shortcut
	wait i feel like i'm forgetting one or two things
	oh
	does 911 work in mayview or is there some wacky and random alternative
	like should i tap my heels together and believe in ambulances
	no need my power's half external materials so it can be seen felt and heard by non-spectrals
	what's your poi- hey whoa no amateur defibrillation
	my point is that his fleshy follower probably heard the lightning and is on his way
	johnny
	speak of the devil he can help
	uh are you referring to ollie or was that imperative 'cause i'm not really down with satanishenanigans
	what have you done nerderers
	let him deal with it c'mon
	what dude
	bro are you ok
	yeah man i'm just chillin'
	see he's fine let's go
	dude you're bleedin'
	oh this ain't blood my impakt krimson deluxe hair dye liquefies upon collision for easy post-tussle reapplication
	but that's neither here nor theer
	i just seen some freaky sights yo
</page>
<page num="35">
	so just ask those questions and mr. spender might let something usefull slip
	uh ok those are things i'd have asked on my own
	lo the slanted manse herein lies our shortcut
	it certainly looms
	bizarre right i love it
	i can see why an architectural tribute to bad posture
	max scared max lash out max words
	wow that last burn was really enhanced by your bad posture
	ease up max there's nothing to be afraid of here it's abandoned pretty cool huh
	eh not my kind of place too much fung not enough shway
	i like to come here to think and also teleport
	what
	master have you succeeded
</page>
<page num="36">
	young master isaac i was expecting someone else
	max meet the shortcut shortcut max
	you refer to me by my function how human
	oh uh i didn't mean anything by it doorman
	if its name is an occupation how is that not also referring to it by its function
	shut up max
	did you not in exchange for my assistance promise to keep me and my location a secret when first we met
	don't worry max won't tell he's new and
	young master isaac you have spoken of your vow to not use your powers to destroy and to use violence only to defend you do not swear these things lightly or without cause this i know
	however
	you broke the promise between us because you did not fear the consequences of doing so i have not the strength to stop you should you decide to reduce me to mere function to make a tool of me you have the storms you have my secrets
	in your heart you knew these things and allowed them to influence your behavior this was in itself a small act of violence thus our bond withers into a power relationship
	or it's just a man who looks like a door that doesn't actually function as a doorman despite dressing like one in which case its name isn't its function it's a description interesting
	you have seen the damage a lightning bolt can do if you wish to be truly just you must understand the destruction wrought by the shadow of a stormcloud
</page>
<page num="37">
	do not forget that your oaths of restraint are a means to an end not the end itself learn to appreciate darkness in its more subtle forms lest its influence deny you the redemption you seek
	i'm sorry doorman i wasn't thinking i
	no i was but only about showing off with your power not about my promise to keep you secret
	what is done is done
	now then where shall i take you and your friend today
	huh but i
	i am always willing to assist
	a true agent of justice
	it is because your heart serves justice young master that such missteps as this torment you so
	ha ha well
	i've got the key right here
	and i the door
</page>
<page num="38">
	let's go
	the absurdity of this situation just hit me all at once
	look at yourselves
	i'm sensing the implications and scale of this ghost stuff and it is making me queasy how do you people take all of it in stride
	it helps that i am not people
	oh jeez everything's tilty
	yes
	isaac tell your magic therapist to turn around light's makin' me dizzy
	you're fine quit stalling and come on through it's perfectly safe
	what if the other side is a simulation in this guy's stomach what if he's eaten us and we live out our lives mistaking extremely slow digestion for the aging process what then
	a moment friend human i am afraid our mutual companion's introduction did not take you were young master
	oh please young master is my rapper name call me max
	i must discuss something serious with you max
	can i just get like the thesis statement
</page>
<page num="39">
	for my own and others' safety i am in hiding please swear that you will tell no one about me or this place can you keep this promise
	i'd laugh
	but i didn't end up with the sense of humor
	your return changes nothing schemer my master does not fear broken gods
	she should would if she could the comedy your ignorance breeds is wasted on my ears well not my ears exactly
	arrogance your power is nothing to be afraid of riddles and word games
	from which speaking esoteric languages won't protect you and i wasn't referring to my faction though you do underestimate us
	we'd better hurry the buses are pulling in
	rolling tubes of screaming children each as worthless as this sanctimonious fool's approval if you must be pious boy choose a proper priest
	huh
	what
	sorry were you saying something
	n-no please proceed
	thanks doorman i'll visit you later
</page>
<page num="40">
	so the doorman's power is
	plug any key in his face and he'll take you through its door
	the key you have is to this room then are students allowed to have those
	is a school club allowed to bring couches up into a class room
	um probably not no was that your point or
	absolutely not
	glrrff
	since when did b.l. start caring about the gut feelings of vigilantes
	if the cousinhood wants to trail their greasy trenchcoats all over my town the least they could do is habeas a gosh dang corpus
	excuse your language texas
	hide max hide
	from mr. spender whyy
	mr. walker darn i can tell this is juicy shop talk but it's all greek to me
	pretty sure that was latin
	i'll half swear all i want you scallion
	outrank my fist
	hey hey isaac did you know that eavesdropping is in itself a small act of vi-o-lence
	sshhhhhhut up
</page>
<page num="41">
	there are no monsters in mayview the cousinhood has no business here i don't see why this warranted a phone call
	honestly it's bad enough seeing you in my dreams every night
	i do declare
	spssshhhh
	gah
	how'd you two get in here
	through the door man
	ow
	ah umm that was
	exactly what it sounded like i suppose
	uh-huh
	aw jeez isaac i think you broke my your principles of nonviolence uh gland
	maxwell you are uninjured
	hm
	yeah i'm fine isaac's fists are like wet bagels
	i was referring to the incident last night ed mentioned something about a fight with a spirit
	oh that turned out all right too
</page>
<page num="42">
	well i am glad no one was hurt
	i don't know about that you should see the other guy
	he's a toilet plunger
	i'm sorry
	apology accepted you sent me home to a house full of spirits you know
	i sent you home with a weapon and a warning not to mention my best fighter's phone number fair safeguards given your premature departure
	best fighter i shoot lightning
	still i am sorry considering the situation running was a realistic if not well reasoned reaction
	i can't stay mad after all that alliteration can you
	yes
	you two seem to be getting along friends already i hope
	in the loose sense of the word sure
	wow rude golden rule isaac
	i am sure maxwell will round out our little group rather nicely then and quads again means squads again spectactical ho ho
	ah you have decided to join the club yes
	oh sure
	but i have a few questions first
</page>
<page num="43">
	i will answer to the best of my ability and or the limits of your authorization
	wow sounds promising first off what's a good place to learn about spectral stuff
	you're looking at him
	well it
	whatever place i am in
	is a good place
	because of me
	i am as it so happens something of an amateur spectral scholar i possess a respectable knowledge of possession the ins and outs of the grudge process studied what little supernatural history there is to study even dabbled in spirit linguistics
	blah blah
	which is to say we have come full circle and you may ask any questions and i will answer to the best of my considerably significant ability
	and or the limits of your significantly less considerable authorization
	no no i mean like besides you
	that's what i mean right
	yes
	i do own a small personal collection of scholarly volumes written by spectrals but
	w-what since when
	since most of my adult life and leading up to when it was eaten
	isabel
	haha don't explain that i want it as is
</page>
<page num="44">
	still though wouldn't it be logical to test your queries out on me before worrying about other sources
	didn't you have a question for mr. spender about mr. spender max
	did you
	i did
	hate you
	ahem
	who do you work for
	the government
	i am after all a public school teacher
	i must say maxwell these are strange questions for a beginner to ask
	his questions make sense i know i wouldn't want to unwittingly be doing spec work for some evil syndicate
	the purely hypothetical organization i may or may not work for is an unequivocal and entirely figurative force for good
	then why not acknowledge its obvious existence i've seen mr. walker seen others in the same weird suits seen those mooks at isabel's place
	isaac i know you're frustrated and i feel very <lang lang="censored">bad</lang> about that but <lang lang="censored">i am not allowed</lang> to <lang lang="censored">discuss such matters</lang> with <lang lang="censored">you for the duration of your possession</lang>
	stop doing that
</page>
<page num="45">
	these are questions you have posed in the past if you wanted to test whether only you were being kept in the dark about certain things you should have had maxwell ask me them in private and report back to you later
	i don't know what you're talking about
	i'm saying your subterfuge is lacking
	huhh
	heh you have a lot to learn before you can trick information out of me isaac
	bit of a catch 22 there sir
	this club seems like a positive learning environment
	that being said answers i can't give you answers you can't read in a book with evidence and insight they can be assembled safely somewhere else can they not
	that's figure stuff out on your own in enormous jerklord is it not
	are you on the drugs
	more than just that employ your imagination
	that was in response to isaac i am perfectly lucid exceedingly lucid at times next question
	actually about last night there was a moment during the fight where like time froze for everything but me well not just me there was this big black spirit i guess came out of nowhere right outside the window
	or what was left of the window everything was ruined and covered in junk and it was sunset all of a sudden or something then all that stuff disappeared and time started moving again so like
	time did not freeze you were just in a state of heightened perception had you remeained in communion with your spirit for longer you would have noticed objects moving albeit very slowly
	ah yeah that's
	my spirit
	whatever being you saw at that time is the spirit inside your tool yes
</page>
<page num="46">
	heightened perception so i'm seeing hidden things like with ghosts
	no no it's in your head like a vision sort of
	isaac could you demonstrate
	hmph i could
	why are you sitting like that
	you heard him pull me in alread-
	should be
	how long was that for you
	umm little less than a minute
	so you see time feels warped because your body and brain are moving so fast your percieved reality is similarly warped by your spirit's influence hence junk ruins etcetera however oh er may i see your backpack maxwell
	uh sure
	thank you
	however the vision is essentially real to you so if you were to say get your head bitten off by your spirit that carries over to real life
	whaat h-h-how is that
	it's a supernatural thing i wouldn't worry about it
	about how it works i mean you should definitely worry about getting your head bitten off
</page>
<page num="47">
	isaac could you demonstrate
	hmph i could
	why are you sitting like that
	you heard him pull me in alread-
	-y
	wow what's your problem
	take a guess
	uh you've got a short temper and a long list of things that make you angry we're just playing visual aid to mr. spender's talk it's no big deal
	i command you to stop doing the glasses man's bidding
	i'm not making a habit of it our interests just happen to align while he's helping out the new spectral if you don't like it you can bum off someone else's spectral energy
	no vessel of my power will be some puppet's puppet
	oh hush up ya blowhard
</page>
<page num="48">
	i don't care how minor the request you will refuse the glasses man's orders as a matter of principle
	ooh you have principles now
	i don't understand isaac child boy why does my fearsome might not inspire the same respect you give the door creature for outlining your inadequacies in vapid sermons
	don't insult doorman he's helped me unlike you
	ha it is easy to preach nonviolence
	when you are weeeeeeaaak
	we are not so different you and i
	groan
	the door's lessons weren't with you when you let loose lightning to scare that sphinx nor when you expressed your annoyance toward the glasses man with electricity though you knew it harmless you may be reluctant to bite but you bare your fangs readily
	grk
	your fury is righteous your anger divine oaths of restraint are not for you you are an agent of judgement
	now hear my sermon let it have few words as befits a god's commandments
	good is that which evil fears
	and justice is when you make those fears a reality
	i'm beginning to think i've already been giving you more respect than i
	should be
</page>
<page num="49">
	morning patrol reporting in
	ah just a moment isabel i believe i've accidentally traumatized the new recruit
	i've never gotten my head bitten off before man i don't wanna take that risk
	now maxwell there is nothing to be afraid of if you feel you are in danger while in a spirit trance simply distance yourself from your tool and the vision will end
	the basis of your connection with your spirit is a mental link if it can't get at your mind it can't hurt you or help you for that matter
	that is why i threw your backpack all the way over there while you're close to that bat your spirit will be sharing your senses so it's wise to not give it any ideas it may not already have
	about murdering you i mean
	yeah i got that thanks
	but look on the bright side
	since your spirit can see what you see it'll know the sort of tough customers it's going to have to deal with if it messes with you
	edward where is your face
	oh it got erased it'll come back mine did
	still waiting on some fingers though
	how is he breathing
	pores
	i am going to die
	so aren't we all life's about doing good with
	no
</page>
<page num="50">
	but look on the even brighter side
	ow
	meeting your spirit is a sure sign that its link with you is reaching maturity which means you'll be getting a power of your own any day now
	i already got magnet powers which is cool and all but not like to die for y'know
	but think of all the loose change you could find and then return to the people who dropped it
	magnet powers you say that's stupendid
	isaac is that an injury
	thank you
	ah it's just a scratch don't
	mrrff
	you're anxious about all this spectral business i get that really i do
	you've had a startling new world appear in front of you and there's a lot to learn you don't know where to start or who to trust
	rrrrgh
	still at the same time it's exciting ghosts and spirits and powers a part of you wants to immerse yourself in it all and just see what happens
	ahaha
	but whether or not everything turns out for the better you don't want to go it alone
	to which i say join the club we all felt the same way still do you won't find anyone more understanding of what you're going through than us
	ahahahahaha

<page num="51">
	so what do you say max care to throw your hat in with the activity club
	uh
	i'll stick around for as long as it's logical the hat stays where it is
	yesss new member
	max you and me are gonna spar
	spar means fight
	yaaah ink on my eyeballs
	wonderful decision maxwell welcome to the team
	we understand i'm a reluctant member right mostly too cool for this
	ah drat there's the bell
	i'll write you a late pass who's your first period teacher
	umm mr. garcia but you should probably make it out to whom it may concern
	very cool isaac very brooding antihero
	you think
</page>
<page num="52">
	we can discuss your responsibilities later for now all i ask is that you keep everything you learned a secret naturally
	why
	late pass where's that pen
	is a pencil ok
	ah thank you
	is a possessed pencil ok
	mmnnyurrh
	please refrain from bringing tools near me until we've confirmed they aren't yellow my mind is in a delicate balance and
	relax it's the erasy spirit from morning patrol it was frosty pink
	also ed and max made this last night grandpa didn't want it 'cause it isn't red said to give it to isaac
	your grandfather does not have rights of first refusal on tools secured by this clu-
	umm
	i don't want that
</page>
<page num="53">
	before i go i've got one last question
	mm
	are you more likely to find a ghost where it died or where she was buried or elsewhere
	the place of death is one's best bet since that is where the ghost is produced
	thanks later
	yes
	that wasn't very subtle
	right
	four stars dead mom
	you're on
	and here i was hoping for a low-maintenance member like ed
	isabel

	umm but there are some customers downstairs
	who appear to be shoplifting glitter and energy drinks
	but that's you know no reason to think they won't buy something afterwards
	what
	in the world do we sell glitter for
	it's used as a spice by deep vegans or so i'm told why do you ask
	huh oh uh no reason
	that's my soda
	since you are busy max i p.j. shall deal with this single handed
	i just um have to find my hand first lefty takes walks
</page>
<page num="4">
	hiya
	isabel
	you missed the target's center by nearly nine centimeters
	you call that a spectral energy compression projectile burstshot
	no i call it a spec-shot i'm a martial artist not a martial scientist
	no one cares what your attack's phylum is grandpa
</page>
<page num="5">
	you can rename my techniques
	after
	you've improved theeem
	grandpa
	that's exactly what renaming them does
	the manipulation of spetcral energy for combat requires absolute mental precision the slightest imperfection in your technique will limit its potential perfect your mind and know limitless power
	a single strike becomes three
	wow sir
	incredible
	a swift jab becomes two dolphins
	we are but worms
	i'm crying sir
	as my granddaughter you must master these techniques and uphold the martial tradition of my style spectral fist
	that was lame
	a lame attack
	i think tradition's kinda wack
	don't you rap at me young lady
</page>
<page num="6">
	i don't need spectral fist i can make whatever i want out of paper just by deciding to
	hrnph you have a lot to learn isabel you are a fool to rely on borrowed power
	i shouldn't have given you that book it's been a bad influence on you
	should have stuck to more wholesome gifts like candy and video computer games
	i'm only training to please you grandpa so it'd be nice if you'd act grateful every once in a while
	nnrgh arrogant girl
	how could such an immaculate and majestic being such as myself produce a descendant with such a flaw
	mohohohoho
	i am free all mankind shall bleed
	somebody grab that spirit those targets are useless if they're intangible to spectral energy

	which i believe will be my autobiography's title
	didjur grandpa chew you out again
	ha i doubt he's capable of that
	'cause he's old and old people have teeth problems
	well he doesn't
	but he deserves to
	wow you're really smacking that puppy
	that would actually be a demon but i understand the mix up
</page>
<page num="8">
	you skipped training
	i chose to train at something i'm passionate about getting better at namely my focus attack dash pause quit restart cancels
	grandpa's gonna get mad
	he seems happy as long as i can defend myself
	why can't he be like that with me i'm the best at defending myself
	the best defense is a preemptive offense
	why does he care that i missed a target by eight centimeters
	missing a target by seven centimeters isn't that big a deal
	same reason you care he cares
	that's probably wishful thinking
	yeah
	wanna play we've got infinite continues so no matter how strong our opponent is they'll ultimately be at our mercy

	yes
	if this room is to some extent a manifestation of my subconscious mind it's only natural that stuff should exit as easy as it enters

	you wanna know the last time i cried fine last week when i passed some roadkill on the highway
	you wanna know what cologne i use fine it's poise by chafresh
	i don't want to know either of those things
	but honesty's a door that swings both ways you gonna pick my brain i'm gonna speak my brain an' i'll tell y'right now ricky boy
	i don't like ya an' i don't trust ya
	i don't like how you won't let no one inside your room not even the boss
	an' i don't trust yer word when y'say yer flocka lambs ain't got no wolves mixed in especially when you won't let no sheepdogs near your pasture
	you're not that dog's master texas it's liable to take a few sheep itself
	farmanalogies aside i'd prefer to have this conversation once b.l. arrives
	what which of those rats told you about that was supposed t'be
	a secret
	please do forgive walker's hypocrisy i asked him not to tell you i'd be here
</page>
<page num="17">
	you know how much i enjoy appearing unexpectedly

	pray tell jeezis
	o-oh
</page>
<page num="18">
	but let's not get off track you were saying something about an extended metaphor
	um
	it's just i was under the impression that the collective opinion of our organization was that the cousinhood of man
	is icky
	i don't know what business this fellow who approached walker thinks he has in mayview but whatever his reasons are they aren't good enough for me
	i completely agree
	hmmmm
	hmmmm
	i wouldn't let those weirdos near any populated area if i could they're dangerous and gross
	like really super icky
	then why would you do what would you what what
	i wanted to see how you'd react
	it was informative
	why were ya keepin' me in the dark about this i put my full weight behind this cousinhood nonsense
	i wanted to see how you'd react
	it was entertaining
	hee hee hoo hoo hee ha ha ha
</page>
<page num="19">
	don't worry rick i would never let a stranger onto your turf without your permission
	which is why we'll send one of our boys to mayview to look into the cousinhood's concerns they might find something you missed
	so that's your game
	faced with the threat of frenzied vigilantes being set loose in my town a visit from a fellow agent sounds like a reasonable alternative
	getting my consent for an internal investigation was your goal all along
	did you set it up this way to spare my feelings it's touching you'd bother though i'm a little insulted you hoped me too dull to realize when i'm being strongarmed
	the cousinhood was that a lie were they even interested in mayview in the first place
	no no they definitely were you just seized the opportunity they presented that's why walker was kept out of the loop
	whatchy'all whisperin' about
	if he's not in on the trick he has no reason to lie about the cousinhood approaching him and i can't claim the whole thing's one big fabrication
	i'm thoroughly trapped even having figured all this out i can hardly refuse a cordial inspection without appearing suspicious not with outside experts raising red flags
	heh well played boss
	don't whine so much rick it's inelegant there's no consolation prize for describing how you lost
	i can't call it a loss that would suggest an internal investigation gives me something to lose
	so would your entire monologue you ridiculous nerd
</page>
<page num="20">
	so when can i expect a drunken cowboy on my doorstep
	ho ho nice try i'm not sending someone you can outsmart ricky boy
	no i'll send walker if i end up needing something broken
	please stop staring at my knees
	agent day will arrive in mayview tomorrow night do be cooperative
	achacha no time to dust
	should i take agent day's selection as a sign you'd prefer all this to end in hugs and sunshine
	no
	ok
	hey rick
	mm
	why're you hitting yourself
	no that's not me
	ha ha but seriously come to the fire we'll discuss the little mission i have for you and your kids

	iono he didn't say prob'ly another agent gonna learn from your grandpa
	ugh they're endless whoever it is better bring their own toothbrush they're not using mine
	the six of us who already are won't stand for that
	well then again we've never done a full club welcomin' party fer anyone before y'think it could be some real important person
	please it's mayview
	no one important ever comes here
</page>
<page num="42">
	hail friend
	up here
	well met doorman sends his regards
	<lang lang="high spirit">you're late</lang>
	yes sorry about that i had to shake my tail
	shake your tail
	teehee i mean i had to escape my pursuers silly
	<lang lang="high spirit">you failed</lang>
	f-failed
	w-well i thought it was funny
	yeah i did
	you serious types are the most fun to crack just wait
	<lang lang="high spirit">no look</lang>
</page>
<page num="43">
	tch i thought i ditched these creeps
	don't bother it's pointless
	vile spirits
	minions of our enemy
	supposedly they seek out and obey the most evil being who'll let them
	roll over
	h-huh w-what do you think you're doing
	l-like that would work we're the good guys remember
	<lang lang="high spirit">
	you're here why to kill me
	you are too weak
	burn
	</lang>
</page>
<page num="44">
	hey hey did you forget
	you're standing right outside mayview's barrier they can't hurt you and you can't hurt them
	our priority right now should be getting you in to our side
</page>
<page num="45">
	they're trying to provoke you we need to talk strategy so ignore them and stay calm ok
	<lang lang="high spirit">
	i am calm
	die
	</lang>
	what did i just say
	it went through you were lugging around a corporeal object this whole time
	you're one serious poltergeist huh
	well i'm not so there's no getting it back you could've used that metal you oaf
	the plan was to have you forge a door we could pull you through if you've got no materials there's no easy way inside
	<lang lang="high spirit">then tell me the hard way</lang>
</page>
<page num="46">
	you're assuming there is a hard way listen the barrier stretches around the whole town and completely blocks out spectrals spirits and everything their powers can throw at it
	ghosts and possessed things pass through just fine so we could smuggle you in via an object overlapping the barrier but
	<lang lang="high spirit">i'd be trapped</lang>
	right and we'd have no ethical way to restore you from whatever twig or boulder you'd be stuck in
	and before you ask the unethical way's too slow trust me
	then there's the ghost train it passes right through the barrier near every night problem is it's guarded human passengers only
	i am
	big and bad and more than a match for blah blah blah
	so say sorcerers storm gods and all the other arrogant dead
	the only difference between you and them is me warning you right now
	if the sunglasses spectral is involved fighting is not an option you're big and you're bad but we've seen him take out the biggest and baddest singular the spirit the strongest one
	you hitch a ride on the ghost train and he shows up you're over
	the easy way is fine then
	yeah i thought so coolguy
</page>
<page num="47">
	you'll have to find enough metal in the surrounding area to make a you sized door and a matching key shouldn't be hard for a master blacksmith the making part at least
	within the next 24 hours doorman will open up a mini portal to you with the usual method he said you'd know what he meant
	<lang lang="high spirit">i do</lang>
	good
	once that's open you drop the key you made through to us and we use it to open a portal to the door you made which you'll use to enter mayview it's simple
	with you on our side we'll be one step closer to our goal
	i am not on your side
	my service comes at a price i have a debt that must be paid
	do not lead these creatures to her as you have led them to me not before she has given me what i want
	<lang lang="high spirit">destroy them</lang>
	not possible we're an awful match up the fight would take forever
	wait for night then flee in the darkness
	please i make my on darkness
